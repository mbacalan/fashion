# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Source lives in `src/`, with UI assets in `src/assets/` and components in `src/components/`. Pages are Astro files under `src/pages/`, and shared layouts reside in `src/layouts/`. Global styles are injected from `src/styles/global.css`; keep Tailwind utility overrides there if ever needed. Static files, including the favicon, sit in `public/`. Build output lands in `dist/` and should never be committed.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `npm run dev` for the local development server (hot reload on `http://localhost:4321`). Run `npm run build` before submitting changes to confirm Astro compiles cleanly. `npm run preview` serves the production build for manual QA once `dist/` has been generated. Execute `npm test` to run the Vitest suite in watch mode, or `npm test -- --run` for a single pass CI-style run.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Astro components should be formatted with two-space indentation and lowercase-kebab filenames (`Welcome.astro` is the exception kept for legacy parity). Favor Tailwind v4 utility classes and mobile-first patterns; avoid arbitrary values unless a design token does not exist. Co-locate component-specific assets and keep shared utilities in clearly named files. Prefer semantic HTML and remove unused imports before pushing.

## Testing Guidelines

Vitest powers unit and integration testing. Place specs alongside their targets (e.g., `src/components/Button.test.ts`) or under `src/tests/` for shared helpers. Favor descriptive `describe` blocks that mirror the component or route name. Run `npm test` during development and `npm test -- --coverage` before pushing to ensure regressions are caught; coverage thresholds should protect render logic, hydration flows, and responsive variants for any new UI you introduce.

## Commit Guidelines

Follow Conventional Commits (`type(scope): subject`) with lowercase, 72-character subjectsâ€”for example `feat(hero): add seasonal banner` or `fix(build): correct astro config`. Keep each commit focused, note behavioral changes or migrations in the body, and list verification commands such as `npm run build` and `npm test` so anyone checking out the branch can replicate results quickly.
