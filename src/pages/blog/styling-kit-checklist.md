# Every detail is intentional

Our rolling kit is designed for agility. Whether we are styling backstage or in a remote warehouse, everything has a labeled compartment. Here is the breakdown we share with new assistants.

## Anchors

- **Dual-voltage steamer** with back-up reservoirâ€”arrives hot in 30 seconds to make tight turnarounds less stressful.
- **Portable garment vacuum** that gently revitalizes beading or feathers without tugging seams.
- **Magnetic rack dividers** to segment looks by scene so the team can glance and grab.

## Micro tools we love

- Silicone **collar stays** that flex, preventing sharp impressions on satin.
- **Clear elastics** in multiple gauges for impromptu cinching.
- A color-coded **stain stick set** for silk, wool, and synthetics.

## Prep rituals

1. Lay out every accessory on velvet boards to avoid scratches.
2. Photograph layered looks on dress forms for quick reference when rebuilding outfits onsite.
3. Keep a shared note with tailoring details so digital and physical teams stay in sync.

## Bonus: crew care

We slot in electrolyte packs, lint-free eye masks, and bluetooth speakers. When the energy stays up, the styling does too.
